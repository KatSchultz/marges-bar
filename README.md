A local bar owner had an outdated website. He wanted a simple site with updated menu prices. I created this new layout using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Google Maps API. 

See the site in action here: https://marges-bar.vercel.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
